# My Idea

I saw a [post](https://groups.google.com/g/brython/c/0HE7DkqS4pg/m/jFSZjmHqBgAJ) on the Brython community forum (a bit old post, I agree, but still interesting) in which someone ask about the possibility of make a desktop app with electron using Brython. 

I really love the idea because Python is my main language, Brython is an awesome project and if it really could be possible so a whole world of possibilities would be opened for Python developers. 

Also it could help us with mobile development using React Native, Ionic or any other JS Framework. Honestly, I dont't like Kivy and it's KV Lang. It sounds like reinventing the wheel... I mean HTML and CSS make all that work and everybody already knows how to do all that stuff.

Browser games with Brython really have impressed me. I know there are some other examples. I just choose this one from [Yakko Majuri](https://github.com/yakkomajuri) because of it's code simplicity... And because The Snake is my favorite retro game :smile:!
